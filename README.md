SpreeAmazonMws
==============

Introduction goes here.

TODO
----

- Add a "remote" Amazon payment type for imported orders
- Import orders via Amazon MWS on a schedule (every 30 minutes, etc)
- Ideally, add integration to cancel/mark as shipped/capture payment

Installation
------------

Add spree_amazon_mws to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_amazon_mws'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_amazon_mws:install
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_amazon_mws/factories'
```
